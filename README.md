- **rest_ecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results.
        Normal.
        Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV).
        Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria.
- **max_heart_rate**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **ex_ind_ang**: Exercise induced angina (Yes, No).
- **prev_peak**: Old peak.
